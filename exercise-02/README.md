Blog system

Make a simple blog system with vanilla PHP.
Pages

    /blog - a list of all blog posts.
    /blog/{id} - a single blog post page.
    /admin - a backend to edit/delete/create posts.

Requirements

    The backend should be password-protected.
    Don't use any existing PHP frameworks or packages.
    Spend little (or no time at all) on the design and CSS.
    Use a CSS framework if you have to make it pretty.

Extra credit

    Create the system with TDD.
